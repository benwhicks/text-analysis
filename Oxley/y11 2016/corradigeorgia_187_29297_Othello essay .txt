Othello will continue to last a lifetime. Shakespeare\'92s Othello, among many of his other plays, force us to sit back and think as well as evoking many emotions within us. Othello focuses on many themes whether that be; racism, jealousy or manipulation, they all force us to think a little deeper. \
\
In today\'92s society it is believed that racism is not a problem, however; Othello shows us that it is still a huge issue. The main character being a black, army general, isn\'92t somethiung audiences would expect or be used to, especially considering the power he held. Many racial slurs are thrown around about Othello before we even meet him. \'93Barbary horse\'94, \'93Black ram\'94 are just a couple of the many slurs used. Although racism is the big issue to think about, it prompts the idea of not judging a book by its cover; \'93Rude am I in my speech; and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace\'94, this linees is one of the first things we hear Othello say, he says the before completely wiping the floor with the cenate with the use of his eloquent language. The audience couldn\'92t help but feel a sense of pride for out tragic hero as he puts everyone to shame. \
\
Manipulation is caused by jealousy a emotion effected by every human. T.S. Elliot said he thought Othello\'92s final speech was \'93a terrible exposure of human weakness\'94, this statement has a level of truth to it. Instead of dying an honourable death, Othello kills himself, after trying to paint a false picture of himself that will live on in history; \'93\'85 of one that loved not wisely but too well/ of one not easily jealous\'94. Othello is speaking a clear lie in an attempt to clean some of his reputation before he dies.\
\
We as an audience know that jealousy would not be accomplished without Iago\'92s manipulation. The audience learn from the very beginning that Iago cannot be trusted \'93I am not what I am\'94, from their everything he says is treated with a sense of scruteny that we don\'92t give the other characters. Although we assume that Iago is telling the audience  that truth, after studying \'93I am not what I am\'94, it makes you wonder if anything he says is really true. Iago tells us that he beleived Othellos is a good husband for Desdemona, yet he still wishes to kill him, in one of his solioquies, however; how do we know if that\'92s the truth, how do we know if everything he says in the whole play is true ot false? THis questioning falls into the idea that if someone lei to you once, or cheats on you once, you forever question the truth behind their words and actions. \
\
Becasue of Iago\'92s jealousy manipulation was made easy for him. From teh very beginning he was viewed as \'93honest Iago\'94, by all the other characters. For us as an audience it can be frustrating that the other characters can\'92t see what\'92s going on. However; we aslo feel sense of respect for Iago due to how clever and consistant he was. Iago always planting just enough seeds of doubt to push Othello closer to the edge yet aviod suspision. Iago\'92s character makes you wonder how easy you, yourself could be manipulated and it, in fact, you been manipulated by someone you believed to be a friend before. \
\
Othello displays the human nature of emotions that are still releivent in today\'92s society. THis span of emotions prompt us to wonder why was Desdemona always so loyal to Othello even to her last breath? How did Othello not see what he was doing until his final moments in the play? Did Iago ever wonder if he was going too far? How could Cassio have allowed his reputation to be tarnished? These questions and many more, along with the emotions they, and the play itself evokes, and their lack of a definite answer are why Shakespeare\'92s Othello will last for a lifetime. }
