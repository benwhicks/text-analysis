As the world continues to spiral into a pit of meaningless and 'trashy' forms of entertainment, people look to the history books to find a quality form of entertainment and more specifically 
towards Shakespeare. Shakespeare uses his ability to create meaningful and empathetic characters to draw the audience in and to encourage them to continue following the stories of these 
characters. As an example, Othello, like all tragic characters, has a fatal flaw, his is his jealousy and irrational thinking when presented with small amounts of evidence. Such is the 
case when Othello literally goes into a seizure after over hearing a conversation between Cassio and Bianca, his inability to cope with the information presented to him and information that is 
not even related to him and is taken out of context by Iago. This seriously effects Othello and destroys his sweet inner self and replaces it with a hellish demon. This forces the audience to 
feel frustrated, making the story compelling and easy to continue watching to the present day.

As the modern audience watches the action of the play they are 'aroused' by the violence and sexual nature of certain scenes. In the modern day the majority of imagery shown in the media 
is of violence an unnatural behaviour, this is why Shakespearean plays, such as Othello, thrive in a society focussed on blood, violence and sex, as is the society of today. The violent 
actions of Othello resonates with modern audiences and they get a 'kick' out of watching the final scenes of the play, where Emilia, Desdemona and Othello end up "as dead as a door knob".
This is why these sexual and violent plays still thrive in the modern society.

As modern audience beg for meaning and violence in their entertainment Shakespeare provides them with the opportunities to for fill these needs, even after over 500 years.
