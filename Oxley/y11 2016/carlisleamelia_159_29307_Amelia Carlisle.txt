\
Reputation is a fragile concept throughout the play of Othello. This concept of what others think leads to the downfall of all the characters in this play. In the first act of the play Iago reveals the reason behind his vengeful plans. \'93\'91 I have already chosen my office\'92 and what was he?\'85 One Michael Cassio\'94 conveys his pure loathing for Cassio and in turn Othello. This is due to a lack of promotion. Iago continues to then destroy Cassio\'92s reputation in an act of demise. \'93Reputation, reputation, reputation. I have lost the immortal part and what remains is bestial\'94 Cassio bellows this showing his immense emotions for his reputation. Through the repetition of the word \'91reputation\'92 exemplifies his concern with his image within society. The specific use of the word \'91immortal\'92 further hyperbolises his tragic fall. The character of Othello murder\'92s his wife, Desdemona, in Act 5 of the play purely because of her crimes of adultery would have ruined his reputation. It can be said that Othello\'92s rage at Desdemona\'92s infidelity is not out of love for her but rather, for himself. It symbolises the destruction go Othello\'92s identity as a strong and powerful man. The line \'93Come my dear love the purchase mad\'85\'94 bluntly states his motives for his marriage to Desdemona. Othello\'92s love for Desdemona is \'93the purchase to be made\'94 as she is a white white woman of high class thus making her a catch for Othello. This obsession with reputation creates questionable morals within the play provoking thought within our modern day audience, particularly nowadays to do with social medias that have created more focus on reputation than ever.\

Othello makes audience question themselves particularly their morals. Through the character of Iago we are forced to take into account the duplicitous nature of all human beings. During Act One Iago compliantly reveals the paradox of human nature \'93 I am not what I am\'94 stating his two-sided nature. Iago has a phenomenal understanding of the human psychology in which he uses to his advantage. Through phrases like \'93 O Beware of jealousy my lord\'94 he convey his knowledge of both good and evil sides to Othello. Throughout the play he orchestrates intricate plans to disgrace Othello. These actions do not make the audience loathe Iago, The audience almost relate to him. This is through common form of duplicitous nature such as gossiping . The character of Iago, although he is fairly extreme, it reminds the audience of the human beings two-sided nature. This issue still resides in todays society.\
\
Tragic heroism is also another main theme that is washed thought Othello. Quite obviously Othello\'92s hamartia is because of his insane jealously. Human beings are prone to having a so-called fatal flaw, one in which if we are not aware of can too lead to our own downfall. The protagonist Othello;s downfall can be blamed on none but himself. His jealousy blinded him from seeing the truth. During his last speech he says \'93Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow as monumental alabaster\'94. This line only speaks of her appearance emphasising Othello\'92s jealousy over her infidelity. The characters of Othello reminds, even a modern day audience of a common fatal flaw, doubt. This doubt has lead to the downfall Othello in the play but also an enormous amounts of human beings today.\'a0\

Shakespeare\'92s Othello appeals to a modern day audience, addressing ever present issues of human phycology. It warns us of the superficial qualities which can compromise our identities and reputation. This issue is even more relevant now due to the influences of social media. The play also reminds us of the dangerously duplicitous nature of human beings. Fatal flaws of doubt and jealousy reside in the play discusses the consequences of not realising this common human flaw. This play will continue ro endure as long as these human issues stand.\
