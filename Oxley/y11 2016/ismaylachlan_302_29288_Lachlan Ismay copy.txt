English Essay\
\
How much can we really think and feel about a bunch of words on a page that were written by a high school dropout over 100 years ago? this is the real question we should be answering about Shakespeare\'92s play \'93Othello\'94. But whatever answer readers come up with, Shakespeare has done us all a service by writing an outstanding play about something we can all relate to, love, hated jealousy. These are all emotions that people feel at any given time which makes the play relatable.\
\
At the beginning of the play we feel lots of love. The love that Othello has for Desdemona, the love that Emilia has for Iago and even the love that Othello has for his country. No matter where you look there is love entwined into every aspect of the play. This aspect of love makes it easy to relate to so that we can feel the love of the characters within ourselves. but it also makes it even sadder when a character falls because we have gotten to know them and learn to connect with them. because of this the play makes us think and feel for the characters.\
\
If we continue reading the play we then arrive at the hate section. this is where Othello promotes Cassio over Iago. Iago really wanted that job so the hate begins to fill the play from within. this is where we start to see Iago\'92s true colours show and his manipulative character come through. He then decides to use this to his advantage to show Othello the same pain Iago felt when he betrayed him. He uses Desdemona and Cassio to show Othello the pain he felt. Later on in the play after Iago has told Othello the lie about Desdemona and Cassio. He then controls Desdemona and asked her for the handkerchief that she gave to him, \'93fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives\'94. When Desdemona can\'92t produce the handkerchief, he starts getting angry at Desdemona. He then shouts at her multiply times \'93Handkerchief\'94. Shakespeare uses repetition here to emphases the rage and hate filled Othello. All readers have gotten angry at someone before and this scene shows us that anyone can get angry and allows us to connect with the characters gain and lets use feel their emotions.\
\
The last and final part of this pays brings me on to the next point which is jealousy. Jealousy is infused into the play at every possible moment. like the jealousy between Iago and Othello or between Iago and Cassio. Jealousy plays a big part in the manipulation of the characters in this play. it is the sole reason why Othello had to kill Desdemona. this is yet another way readers can connect and feel the emotions of the characters because we have all been jealous before.\
\
\'93Othello\'94 is a very well written play which makes us feel ad think about all aspects of the play because of the reasons I have stated.}
