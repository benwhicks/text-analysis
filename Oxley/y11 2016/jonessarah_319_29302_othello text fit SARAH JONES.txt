We have gotten stuck in the nooks and crannies of the play. As the readers are able to both unpack and relate to Shakespeare \'93Othello\'94 we are engaged by what we have learnt and felt. There is no doubt that the foreign language in \'93Othello\'94 keeps us - the readers, reminiscing thoughts and assumptions in our minds having either positive, negative or fence sitting impressions on us as readers. However, the need to explore and discover what Shakespeare is trying to tell us through these fictional characters must be on the \'91To do list\'92 as an understanding will only then be met. The idea of unpacking a character or discovering who they really are is really typically the scaffolding to the heart of \'93Othello\'94 and why the love for it has stayed with us. Feeling relatable with characters and/or what we can take home from the play are all very clear indications as to the aligning of our interest to the play. \

Obviously, one of the many things that Shakespeare found extremely important within his plays, was a yearn for the audience to have a personal opinion on the plot of his plays. He always wanted the audience to be thinking and learning. As new generations kept blooming out of the human race, this opened a perfect opportunity for Shakespeare new and old observes to stay intrigued and entertained. \'93Thee has \'91twixted\'92 my sheets\'94 throughout the play jealousy and lack of localness shines through. This was found to be outrageous in the Elizabethan period, I mean still is now but for a black man back then\'85 Just totally unexpectable. Never the less, Iago\'92s undeceive mind and insecurity ultimately caused chaos and death. Providing evidence that Othello is now unwittingly sleeping around with Iago\'92s wife, Emilia. Iago turned his jealousy from the promotion (Victimizing himself) to his wife (what he \'93possesses\'94). At first it is easy to conclude that what Shakespeare could be intriguing us with is a twisted love story and an idea of betrayal. On the other hand, unpacking and thinking about this scene can lead us to the underlying message of assumption and predictions. How it can cause uprising in problems. The reader that believed or thinks this however, will continue to do just that. Presume and assume \'93what will happen next\'94 \

Well i can confidently inform you that what happens next is relations made with the plot and characters. Either through personal experiences of in our self we can reflect a common ora off this play. \'93Othello\'94 doesn\'92t Lack an emotion or idea. Found from simply quotes from the characters \'93I do hate him as hell pains\'94 To subplots and stories. Love, hate, manipulation etc is all part of humanity and Shakespeare constructed \'93Othello\'94 so it was to accept in one way or another. Yet going beyond the everyday run of the mill life story. He has woven through so many more aspects.\
