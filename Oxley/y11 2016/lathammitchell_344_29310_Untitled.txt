\f0\fs24 \cf0 Othello basks in its own contradiction. The didactic nature of the play forces us to re-imagine our values and our standpoint of issues such as dishonesty and hate - or even whether it all matters. In the final scene, Shakespeare forces us to contemplate the Proto-Post-Modern idea that all life is unsatisfactory; thus, rendering all other lessons learned trivial. Moreover, the vast spectrum of human emotion as displayed by both Iago and Desdemona makes us rethink our standpoint on whether \'91hate\'92 is actually better than \'91love\'92. With all these cynical points aside, he character Emilia represents something a little more positive: she rises up and becomes something more than the audience imagined - a brave, stand-alone out speaker who was not afraid to break social mores. Her contribution to the play is a clear contrast to the the constant stream of pessimism. It is contrasts such as this which Shakespeare clearly uses to drive these lessons into our heads, forcing us to think and feel ideas which may be new to them.\

Towards the beginning of the play, especially in Acts 1 and 2, Othello os portrayed a proud, dignified war general who is both respected and respects himself. In Act 1, he boasts of his achievements often - saying that he has come across many a \'93siege and fortune\'94 before. In fact, Coleridge once stated that \'93Shakespeare portrays Othello as the very opposite of a jealous man\'94. However, as the as the play goes on, Othello\'92s opinion of himself deteriorates very quickly. In fact, when at the end of the play, he exclaims that the reason for his death was \'93unlucky\'94 circumstances, one is forced to conclude that Othello is now but a shadow of what he once was. Here, dramatic irony is used, as the audience knows that the reason for Othello\'92s downfall is Iago - yet Othello maintains cluelessly that the blame falls to luck.}
