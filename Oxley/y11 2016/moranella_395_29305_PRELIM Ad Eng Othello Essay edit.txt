Jealousy is inevitable. From fairytales to current political disputes, jealousy is too often the catalyst for dispute. This truth lies at the heart of Othello. This thematic concern, prevalent in Shakespeare\'92s tragic play, forces audience members and readers to consider the destructive nature of this emotion. The renowned playwright\'92s intention is to make audience members react to the circumstances in the play and in turn understanding deeply the destructive nature of jealousy. Shakespeare grapples with the destructive nature of jealousy. 
\f1 It is jealousy which prompts antagonist Iago to plot Othello\'92s downfall. Iago\'92s deception and manipulation catalyses the thematic concern of jealousy. Moreover, Othello himself demonstrates how personal insecurity and vulnerability can fuel the fire of jealousy. \

\cf0 Vulnerability is the rectant of jealousy. This concern forces us to think and consider the potential of envy. Protagonist, Othello, is depicted as an honest and sincere character. Shakespeare exemplifies this quality of Othello\'92s in Act 1, where the powerful general admits to being a shy lover. Later in the play, this trait of Othello\'92s is manipulated by Iago, who convinces him that his wife Desdemona is unfaithful. This situation reveals Othello\'92s \'93tragic flaw\'94. A. C. Bradley believed that Shakespearean tragedy is characterised by the "tragic flaw," the internal imperfection in the hero that brings him down. His downfall becomes his own doing, and he is no longer the helpless victim of fate. Some say that Othello's tragic flaw is jealousy, which flared at suspicion and was unchecked by common sense. A more modern interpretation would say that Othello's tragic flaw is that he has come to believe the prejudices of those that surround him, that a black man is an unattractive creature, unworthy of love. As a result, he doubts that Desdemona can truly love him. Iago suggests this idea and Othello rushes to accept it, because, perhaps, it echoed his deepest fears and insecurities. Othello\'92s jealousy grows in the face of his inescapable insecurities. This theme emphasises the power of jealousy. \
\
T.S. Eliot further explores this concept. He states that Othello\'92s egotistical nature influences his jealousy, \'93(Othello is) so in love with self image that he is incapable of loving Desdemona except as the projection of his own ideal. The slightest suspicion of that ideal \'96 makes him easy prey for Iago\'94. Thus, Eliot forces us to consider the cause of of jealousy, in our day to day lives. This is encapsulated in Act 1, Scene 3 whereby Othello describes himself as almighty, exotic and strong in battle, stating \'93scapes I\'92th\'92imminent deadly breach\'94. He goes on to say \'93the only witchcraft\'94 he has used to seduce Desdemona, is his charm itself. Othello\'92s manipulation of language in suggesting that his brilliance is as powerful as witchcraft, demonstrates his hubristic personality. This suggests that his love for Desdemona is merely a reflection of his desire to appear courageous and powerful. Therefore, his vulnerabilities lie in maintaining his self image. \
\
Iago\'92s deceptive nature is a reflection of his jealous tendencies. Shakespeare forces audience members and readers to consider how envy can alter our mindsets and persona. At the conclusion of Act 1 Scene 1, Iago reveals his manipulative nature stating, \'93I am not what I am\'94. This phrase is a paradox, as he suggests the way he seems differs from his true self. This foreshadows Iago\'92s deceptive actions which, continue over the course of the play. Iago metaphorically staes, \'93poison his delight\'94, suggesting his intentions to decieve and disconcern Brabantio. At the conclusion of Act 1 Scene 2, Iago further exhibits the power of manipulation through suggestion, as he prompts Othello to doubt Cassio. However, Othello\'92s naivety facilitates his downfall, through his failure to recognise Iago\'92s jealousy-fuelled motivations. Shakespeare suggests that jealousy can be masked by other traits. This forces us to consider how jealousy may be prevalent in our own personalities. \
\
\cf2 Antagonist Iago is clever with words, yet evil at heart. Perhaps, Shakespeare intends for audience members to take a look in the mirror and think about how this is reflected into reality. He is unable to let go of his jealousy and hatred towards both Cassio and Othello. Thus, he devises scheme after scheme to destroy them. Iago is so blinded by his envy that he cannot foresee that his plan will ultimately destroy him as well. 
\f0 \cf0 The use of soliloquy is effective in revealing Iago\'92s character, foreshadowing plot developments and increasing both dramatic irony and dramatic tension throughout the play. This can be seen at the conclusion of the first scene in Cyprus, in which Iago speaks of his motives in seeking revenge on Othello. He says \'93Now, I do love her\'85But partly led to diet my revenge\'94. This situation employs dramatic irony, as the audience is aware of Iago\'92s Machiavellian intentions, whilst the Othello is not. The phrase \'93partly led\'94 Iago\'92s jealousy fuels his desire to take revenge on Othello. \
\
The dramatic device of the subplot is typical in Shakespearian theatre. However, it is notably absent in \ul Othello\ulnone . Shakespeare often uses a subplot to enhance the audience\'92s understanding of the play\'92s themes and characterisation. The single plot in \ul Othello\ulnone  directs the audience\'92s focus to the main themes of the play, in particular the destructive nature of jealousy. Audience members and readers are given no respite from the intense main plot. \
\
Jealousy is a destructive but perennial aspect of the human condition. Shakespeare\'92s tragic \ul Othello\ulnone  forces us to see the traits of our personality which we are unable to fully understand. We are forced to think, feel and understand the true impacts of the detractive nature of jealousy. Despite the centuries which have elapsed since Shakespeare wrote Othello, his exploration of the impact of jealousy is as relevant today as when the play was written. 
\f1 The consequences of jealousy are exemplified in the character of Othello, as he allows his personal insecurities to fuel the fire of jealousy. Furthermore, Iago demonstrates how jealousy can be used manipulatively to destroy others. This is emphasized through the use of various dramatic features, particularly soliloquy. Jealousy is the catalyst for all evil. Shakespeare\'92s \ul Othello\ulnone  encapsulates this idea. \
