\f0\fs24 \cf0 Jealousy can only exist where there is a lack of self confidence or self value. Shakespeare makes the audience think and feel this way primarily through the example of Othello. It is evident that Othello\'92s self-doubt and the judgemental remarks of other characters allow jealousy to be his hamartia. Contrastingly, the audience are able to witness how confidence and high self-esteem can benefit characters such as Iago who use their jealous feelings to their advantage. Shakespeare is attempting to make the audience think about the dangers that lack of self confidence can have around emotions such as jealousy. \
\
Othello begins as a noble, warrior in the first scenes of the play. Slowly, we witness that Othello\'92s awareness of his race and insecurities allow the easy manipulation by Iago to bring about his jealousy. Othello references his skin colour a number of times throughout the play when he declares \'93her face, which was as fresh as Dian\'92s visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face.\'94 Othello increasingly doubts his self value and self worth under the guidance of Iago who leads him to believe Desdemona has \'93appetites\'94 for Cassio. The audience are able to get a real feel for Othello\'92s insecurities which paired with jealousy are his tragic flaws in the scenes with the symbolic handkerchief. The handkerchief which is a symbol of Desdemona and Othello\'92s love ends up in the hands of Cassio due to Iago\'92s evil scheming therefore allowing Othello to suspect his wife\'92s affair with Cassio. When Othello says to Desdemona \'93lend me thine handkerchief\'94 and she can not, Othello is able to affirm his suspicions driving him mad with jealousy. Earlier in Othello\'92s soliloquy, the audience are able to witness how Othello is beginning to doubt himself and doubt Desdemona\'92s love for him. Clearly Othello\'92s lack of self confidence and self esteem are one of the biggest contributing factors to how he allows jealousy infiltrate his heart and mind. \
\
Othello has lasted so long and stayed so popular as a play due to the didactic nature of the play which allows the audience to think and feel. Othello is heavily judged by those around him throughout the play also. Iago is constantly saying how he \'93hates the moor\'94 and even Emilia acknowledges Othello\'92s race in saying \'93O she the angel and you the blacker devil.\'94 Iago\'92s animalistic references when referring to Othello saying things such as \'93an old black ram is tupping your white ewe\'94 and \'93making the beast with two backs\'94 make it impossible for Othello to ignore such remarks. He lets other\'92s judgements get the better of him and \'93in a sense, what Othello is doing is executing the Iago under his own skin\'94-Matt Simpson. Shakespeare\'92s play teaches the audience to think about how a lack of self confidence that can be brought on by other people\'92s judgements can allow envy to cause the downfall of someone (in this case it\'92s Othello). \
\
Whilst Othello lets his lack of self confidence and self esteem bring jealousy into his mind, lingo does the opposite. Iago uses his confidence and scheming nature to make his jealousy a means for revenge. In using his superior (Othello) as his puppet, he is able to get revenge on Othello for appointing \'93arithmetician, one Micheal Cassio\'94 as his lieutenant and for the lusty moor leaping \'93into his seat.\'94 Iago even ironically warns Othello saying \'93O beware my lord of  jealousy. Tis the green eyed monster.\'94 Iago does even have to give real evidence of Desdemona cheating to bring Othello down stating \'93trifles light as air to jealous confirmations strong.\'94 Where Othello lets jealousy be his ultimate downfall, Iago is the opposite which teaches people to think about whether they choose to let jealousy get the better of them or not. \
\
Shakespeare\'92s Othello teaches the audience to think and feel carefully about wether they let their insecurities get the better of them or whether they choose to be like Iago, and use jealousy to their advantage. }
